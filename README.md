# CardPocket

CardPocket is an Android application that allows users to scan and store their loyalty cards on their smartphone. 
The application was developed as part of my dissertation.
The logo for CardPocket and The application itself (excluding the Zxing Scanner) was developed and designed by me (A Moran).
As mentioned the application has the ZXING library implemented which can be found at: https://github.com/zxing/zxing. 
Many Thanks to them and anyone else who has contributed to the ZXING Library :).

**The application is currently at prototype level, and will be developed further at a later date. 


To install the application on a device, follow the location:
CardPocket\app\build\outputs\apk 

*The apk is unsigned, so please take care when installing.
