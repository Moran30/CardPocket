# CardPocket

CardPocket is an Android application that allows users to scan and store their loyalty cards on their smartphone. 
The application was developed as part of my dissertation at Sheffield Hallam University.
The application has the ZXING library implemented which can be found at: https://github.com/zxing/zxing. Many Thanks to them! 

**The application is currently at prototype level, and will be developed further at a later date.
